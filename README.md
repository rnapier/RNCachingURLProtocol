# BACKGROUND

RNCachingURLProtocol is a simple shim for the HTTP protocol (that’s not
nearly as scary as it sounds). Anytime a URL is downloaded, the response is
cached to disk. Anytime a URL is requested, if we’re online then things
proceed normally. If we’re offline, then we retrieve the cached version.

The point of RNCachingURLProtocol is mostly to demonstrate how this is done.
The current implementation is extremely simple. In particular, it doesn’t
worry about cleaning up the cache. The assumption is that you’re caching just
a few simple things, like your “Latest News” page (which was the problem I
was solving). It caches all HTTP traffic, so without some modifications, it’s
not appropriate for an app that has a lot of HTTP connections (see
MKNetworkKit for that). But if you need to cache some URLs and not others,
that is easy to implement.

You should also look at [AFCache](https://github.com/artifacts/AFCache) for a
more powerful caching engine that is currently integrating the ideas of
RNCachingURLProtocol.

# USAGE

1. To build, you will need the Reachability code from Apple (included). That requires that you link with
   `SystemConfiguration.framework`.

2. At some point early in the program (usually `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`),
   call the following:

      `[NSURLProtocol registerClass:[RNCachingURLProtocol class]];`

3. There is no step 3.

# EXAMPLE
